This project wasnt that bad. The only big issue was the cordinates were
bad so i redid the coordinates for the house so its easier. The colors 
are randomized for the house so the colors change with ever iteration.

One of the additional things I have implemented was a randomized color
generator. It generates the colors randomly for the house. Another 
thing I have implemented is a key-framing system that is completely 
independent of the framerate, meaning that the person who runs the 
program will get similar results just with a different framerate. This
means the timing is going to be close to exact the same on both screens.
Its defined in moves over time and implements a linear equation relating
 the two over the time.

I learned alot about the keyframing system and some odd idiosyncracies 
between javascript and other languages. I feel like i fight Javascript
more than the assignment itself, but i digress.

Its up one folder in assignment. Common is there so it can run
