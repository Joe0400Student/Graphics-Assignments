The program was not that hard to develop. Most of the time was 
figuring out how to make the interface easily and usable.
The program uses DDA and midpoint algorithms for lines
Midpoint Algorithm for circles, ecclipses, and three 
different curve implementations

It seems like it matches perfectly with the implementation 
provided for this assignment. You can see with each phot i used
the same settings for each one. Its also important to note that
I also fixed the slope issue for each one as when the slope is
infinite it would end up with a divide by zero.
